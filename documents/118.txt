HPLC was used for the determination of R-keto acids and organic acids. The reaction mixture was prepared as described above and incubated in a model 717 auto sampler (Waters, Milford, MA) at 40 \'b0C. At regular intervals, samples (25 \'b5L) were taken and injected to the system. For the analysis of polar molecules (pyruvic acid, 2-oxobutyric acid, 2-oxopentanedioic acid, and oxalate) the system consisted of a LC-10AT pump (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), pumping 0.01 M methane sulfonic acid with an isocratic flow of 0.6 mL/min over a Rezex Fast Fruit precolumn (100- d7 7.8-mm) and a double Rezex Organic Acid column (300- \'d7 7.8-mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, Ca) at 30 \'b0C. The other acids were analyzed using the same system, but equipped with a wide pore C18-RP column (250- \'d7 4.6-mm, Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands), and components were eluted at 40 \'b0C with a gradient from 5 to 30% acetonitrile in demineralized water containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA). A model 1481 Lamda-max detector (Waters, Milford, MA) was used at 220 nm to detect the compounds in both system configurations.
