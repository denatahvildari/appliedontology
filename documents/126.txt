High-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was performed on three TSK gel columns (7.8 mm ID!30 cm per column) in series (G4000PWXL, G3000 PWXL, G2500PWXL; Tosohaas, Japan), in combination with a PWXL-guard column (Tosohaas, Japan). Elution was at 30 8C using 0.2 mol/L sodium nitrate at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The elution was monitored using a Shodex SE-61 Refractive Index detector. Calibration was performed using pollulans (Polymer laboratories, UK).
