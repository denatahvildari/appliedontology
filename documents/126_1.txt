For high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) analysis, a Thermo Quest HPLC is used which included a quaternary gradient pump and AS3000 auto-sampler completed with a Helium degassing unit and a PED detector in PAD mode (Dionex, USA). The data was processed using a Thermo Quest PC 1000 data handling system. A CarboPac PA1 column (4!250 mm) with guard column (Dionex, USA) was operated at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 20 8C. The gradient was obtained by mixing solutions of 0.1 mol/L NaOH and 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. After 15 min equilibration with 0.1 mol/L NaOH, 20 mL of the sample was injected and a linear gradient to 0.50 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH within 30 min was followed by a linear gradient in 5 min to 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH.
