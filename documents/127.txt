High-performance size-exclusion chromatography was performed on three TSKgel columns (7.8'a0mm ID\'a0'd7'a030'a0cm per column) in series (G4000 PWXL, G3000 PWXL, G2500 PWXL; Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany), in combination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany). Elution took place at 30 with 0.2'a0M sodium nitrate at 0.8'mL/min. The eluate was monitored by refractive index detection using a Shodex RI-72 detector. Calibration was performed using dextrans.
