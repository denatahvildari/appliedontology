High-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was performed with three Tosoh Biosciences TSK gel columns (G 4000, 3000, 2500 PWXL, each 300! 7.5 mm) in series and in combination with a PWXL guard column (Tosoh Biosciences; 40!6 mm). Elution was performed at 30 8C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.8 ml/min. The eluate was monitored using a Shodex SE- 61 refractive index detector. Twenty microliters of pectin (5 mg/ml) were injected.
