Aliquots (300 \ 5L) of SPI solution and hydrolysate solutions were mixed with 510 mL of 0.15 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 100 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) and 8 M guanidinium chloride. After 1 h of stirring at ambient temperature, 310 mL of acetonitrile and 200 L of 8 M guanidinium chloride, containing 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), were added, and the mixture was stirred for another 1 h. After centrifugation (15 min, 22000g, 20 C), the supernatants were applied to a Shodex Protein KW-803 column (300  8 mm; Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The column was equilibrated with 40% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min, and the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 220 nm. According to the manufacturer\'92s specification, the void volume of the column was  5.7 mL. The included volume was estimated using GlyTyr (238 Da) and was observed to be 12.4 mL. For the SPI solution separate fractions were collected and dried in an ALPHA-RVC CMC-1 rotating vacuum concentrator (Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany) followed by analysis by gel electrophoresis.
