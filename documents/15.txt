Alditol acetates were prepared according to the method of Englyst and Cummings (1984) and were separated on a Supelco SP-2380 (Bellefonte, PA) column (30 m, 0.32 mm, i.d., 0.2 \'b5m film thickness) in a chromatograph (Chrompack 9011, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a flame-ionization detector. The carrier gas was He. Separation was at 225\'b0C with injection and detection temperatures of 275\'b0C. \uc0\u946 -D-allose was used as internal standard (1.0 mL added with a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL).
