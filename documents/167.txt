PGXA, PGXB, PGXC and RGXB were purified by dialysis overnight at 4\'a0\'b0C against 50\'a0mM NaOAc (pH'a05.7) and subsequent size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50'a0mM NaOAc (pH'a05.7). The elution was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1'a0ml/min, and fractions of 2'a0ml were collected.}
