Anion Exchange Chromatography (AEC). A 25 mL Source Q XK 26/10 column was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, using an A\'a8 kta explorer system (GE Healthcare) and loaded with sample at 10 mL min-1. After washing, a 10 column volume linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, was applied at a flow rate of 10 mL min-1. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm, and appropriate fractions were collected}
