 The composition of the reaction mixture (UDPFig sugars and heparosan oligosaccharides) was analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) using an ICS-3000 Ion Chromatography HPLC system equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2??~ 250 mm), in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column (2??~25 mm), a VWD-3100 single wave detector (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA), and a pulsed electrochemical detector in pulsed amperometric detection mode (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in series. The same elution conditions as previously described were used (Chavaroche et al. 2011). The presence of a peak with UV detection, as with electrochemical detection, shows the presence of an UDP group (Orellana and Mohnen 1999).
