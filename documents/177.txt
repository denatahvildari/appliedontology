High-performance size-exclusion chromatography was per-formed on a Thermo Separation Products HPLC systemequipped with a membrane solvent-degasse r, three TSKgelcolumns (7.8 mm ID 30 cm per column) in series(G4000, G3000, G2500; Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany), incombination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas). Elutiontook place at 308C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.8 mL/min.The eluate was monitored using a refractive index (RI)detector (Shodex RI-71). Calibration was perfo rmed usingpullulans (Polymer Labs, Shropshire, UK).}
