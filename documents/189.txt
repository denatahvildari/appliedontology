Experiments were performed with an Akta Purifier System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Hydrolysis products were separated with an analytical Shodex Protein KW-802.5 column (300 8 mm; particle size: 7 mm; pore size: 500 A\uc0\u730  ; Showa Denko K. K., Kanagawa, Japan). The column was equilibrated with 6 M urea containing 30% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The flow rate was 0.5 mL min f1  f0 1 and the column temperature 20 1C. A sample volume of 20 mL was injected onto the column. Detection was performed at 220 nm.
