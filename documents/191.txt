Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used for the analysis of pea saponins. Evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) was used for detection and ion trap electro spray mass spectrometry (MS) was used for component identification. A Spectra SYSTEM HPLC (Thermo Separation Products, Fremont, CA), coupled to a Sedex 55 ELS detector (S.E.D.E.R.E., Alfortville, France), was used. Separation was performed using an Aquasil reversed phase C18 column (4.6 \'b7 150 mm, 3 lm) (Thermo Hypersil, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The solvents used were water:acetic acid (100:0.001, v/v) (A) and acetoni trile:acetic acid (100:0.001, v/v) (B). The gradient used was as follows: 0 ! 8 min, 40 ! 50% B; 8 ! 10 min, 50 ! 100% B; 10 ! 15 min, 100% B (isocratic); 15 ! 20 min, 40% B (isocratic). Samples of 20 ll were injected and a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used. The eluate from the column was split into three directions: 100 ll min to the ELSD, 50 ll/min to the LCQ Ion-trap MS (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) and 850 ll/min to the waste.
