Aliquots (10 \'b5L) of each sample were analyzed using an HPLC (Waters M600 liquid chromatography system) equipped with an Alltima C18 column, 150 mm \'d7 4.6 mm (Alltech, Breda, The Netherlands). The gradient was made with ultrapure water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. The flow rate used was 1.0 mL/min. A linear gradient from 10 to 30% (v/v) acetonitrile in water was applied during 12 min. The percentage of acetonitrile was kept at 30% (v/ v) for 2 min, increased to 100% in 3 min, and was kept at 100% for 2 min. The retention time of 1\uc0\u8242 -hydroxymethyleugenol was 16.4 min under these conditions. Detection was carried out by a Waters 996 photodiode array detector at 280 nm.
