To obtain series of more defined ovalbumin variants, ion exchange chromatography (Biopilot, Pharmacia, MN) was used with a Source Q 900 mL column. A 200 mL amount of a 5 mg/mL protein solution in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer was applied to the column at a flow rate of 15 mL/min and eluted using a gradient from 0.08 M NaCl, pH 6.0, to 1.00 M NaCl, pH 6.0.
