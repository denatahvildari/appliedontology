gas chromatograph (CE Instruments, Milan, Italy) was equipped with a CP-SIL 5 CB Low bleed column (30 m \'d7 0.25 mm; film thickness 1.0 \'b5m; Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The oven temperature was initially 40 \'b0C for 5 min, then raised at 15 \'b0C/min to 150 \'b0C and was kept at 150 \'b0C for 5 min. Inlet and detector temperatures were 250 and 225 \'b0C, respectively. Gas flow rates were as follows: hydrogen, 35 mL/ min; air, 350 mL/min; makeup nitrogen, 30 mL/min. The headspace concentrations were expressed as peak areas in arbitrary units.
