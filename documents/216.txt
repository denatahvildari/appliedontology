all samples were centrifuged (15 min, 24000g, 20 \'b0C), and 100 \'b5L was injected onto a reversed phase C18 column (218MS52; 250 \'d7 2.1 mm, 5\'b5m) (Grace Vydac, Hesperia, CA), installed on a Spectra System HPLC (Thermo Separation Products, Fremont, CA). A flow rate of 0.2 mL/min was used. The solvents used were deionized water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.085% (v/v) formic acid (solvent B). The elution used was as follows: from 0 to 10 min, 5% B (isocratic); linear gradient to 45% B until 80 min; linear gradient to 95% B until 90 min; isocratic elution with 95% B for 5 min; linear gradient to 5% B until 96 min followed by isocratic elution with 5% B until 110 min. All HPLC operations and data processing were controlled by Chromeleon version 6.7 software (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). After UV detection at 214 nm
