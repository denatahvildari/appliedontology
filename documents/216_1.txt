Glycinin, its DH 2.2 hydrolysate, the aggregating peptide fraction thereof, and the tryptic hydrolysate of the aggregating peptides were analyzed with size exclusion chromatography. Samples were dissolved under denaturing (8 M guanidinium chloride) and reducing conditions (100 mM DTT). Of each sample 50 \'b5L was injected and separated with a Shodex Protein KW-803 column (300 \'d7 8 mm; Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated and eluted with 6 M urea containing 30% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/ min, and the eluate was monitored at 214 nm.
