Gel filtration chromatography was performed on \uc0\u945 -lactalbumin (2.86 g L\u8722 1) and lysozyme (2.84 g L\u8722 1) modified at pH 6 using PPO. Aliquots (20 \'b5L) of the native and modified proteins were applied on a Shodex KW-803 column (8 mm \'d7 300 mm, flow rate 0.6 mL min\u8722 1; Showa Denko Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany) and eluted using acetonitrile (400 mL L\u8722 1) containing TFA (1 mL L\u8722 1) in a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Separation Products Inc., Riviera Beach, FL, USA). Protein elution was detected at 280 nm and CQA elution at 324 nm.}
