An Akta purifier system equipped with an A-900 autosampler (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the separation of pectins on a Dionex PropacTM WAX-10 column (WAX; 250 4 mm). After an equilibration step of 10 min (1 ml/min) with \'91\'91Millipore\'92\'92 water, 200 ml of pectin solution (5 mg/ml) was injected (pectin powder was wetted in ethanol prior to solubilisation in water). Elution (1 ml/ min) was performed with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.6 M of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6) in 15 min and the gradient was held at 0.6 M sodium phosphate (pH 6) for 25 min. At the end of the gradient, the column was washed for two min with \'91\'91Millipore\'92\'92 water and was then eluted with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide for 8 min. Detection was accomplished with an UV detector (Amersham Biosciences) set at 215 nm.
