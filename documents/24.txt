Qualitative detection of nisin was performed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC on a Hi-Pore PR-318 column (250 mm\'d74.6 mm; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), using a linear gradient of 23\'9628% buffer B (90% aqueous acetonitrile, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid) for 50 min with a flow rate of 1 mL min\uc0\u8722 1. Absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. Lactococcus lactis subsp.
