Fractionation of the aggregating peptides was performed with a preparative HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) controlled by MassLynx version 4.0 software using an XTerra Prep MS C18 OBD column (50 \'d7 100 mm; bead diameter ) 5 \'b5m, Waters). The flow rate was 82.7 mL/min and the column temperature, 20 \'b0C; eluent A was 0.07% (v/v) TFA in 5% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile, and eluent B was 0.05% (v/v) TFA in acetonitrile. Sample preparation was as follows: the freeze-dried pellet was dissolved in 8 M guanidinium hydrochloride containing 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.07% (v/v) TFA, at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. A volume of 10 mL of sample was injected onto the column. After 5 min of isocratic elution with eluent A, further elution was obtaine with a linear gradient from 0 to 31% eluent B in 9.8 min, then from 31 to 40% eluent B in 17.1 min, from 40 to 100% B in 6.7 min, and 100% B for 3.7 min. Detection was performed at 220 nm.
