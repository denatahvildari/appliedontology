Samples were separated on an analytical Vydac C8 column (208MS52; 250 \'d7 2.1 mm; bead diameter ) 5 \'b5m; porosity ) 300 nm; Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) by HPLC (Thermo Separation Products Inc., San Jose, CA) with ChromQuest software. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min and the column temperature, 20 \'b0C; eluent A was 0.07% (v/v) TFA in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and eluent B was 0.05% (v/v) TFA in acetonitrile. A volume of 30 \'b5L of sample was injected onto the column. After 10 min of isocratic elution with eluent A, further elution was obtained with a linear gradient from 0 to 55% eluent B in 100 min, then from 55 to 100% eluent B in 2 min, and 100% B for 20 min. Detection was performed at 220 nm.
