HPSEC was performed on a Thermo Separation Products (San Jose, USA) HPLC system equipped with a membrane solvent-degasser, three TSKgel columns (4.8 mm ID \'b7 30 cm per column) in series (G4000 PWXL, G3000 PWXL, G2500 PWXL; Tosohaas (Stuttgart, Germany)), in combination with a PWXLguard column (Tosohaas). Elution took place at 30 C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.8 ml min1 . The eluate was monitored using a refractive index (RI) detector (Shode   (Kawasaki, Japan) RI-71).
