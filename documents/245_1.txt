 High-performance anion-exchange was performed on
a Thermo Separation Products (San Jose, USA) system
equipped with a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) CarboPac
PA-20 column (3 mm ID 150 mm) in combination with
a Dionex CarboPac PA guard column (3 mm  25 mm)
and PAD-detection (Dionex). For the analysis of xylose
and glucose in the hydrolysates, an isocratic elution
(0.5 ml min1) of 20 min was carried out with 18 mM
NaOH. Each elution was followed by a washing (5 min
300 mM NaOAc) and two equilibration steps (5 min
100 mM NaOH and 15 min 18 mM NaOH).
