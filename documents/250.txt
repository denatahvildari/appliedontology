To determine the molecular weight distribution of the lignan macromolecule and the saponified lignans, aliquots of 50 ll (2 mg/ml) were analyzed on a similar HPLC system as described for analytical RP-HPLC, equipped with a Tricorn Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL column (Amersham Bioscience; 10 \'b7 300\'96310 mm, bed volume = 24 ml, optimum separation range 100\'967000 Da). The column was run isocratically at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 40% (v/ v) aq. ACN + 0.1% (v/v) TFA as eluent. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm.
