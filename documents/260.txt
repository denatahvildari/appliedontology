Xylan and xylan fractions were dissolved in pure water
(4 mg/mL) and subjected (20 ll) to HPSEC. High-performance
size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a
Thermo Separation Products HPLC system equipped with a
membrane solvent-degasser, three TSKgel columns (7.8 mm
ID \'b7 30 cm per column) in series (G4000, G3000, G2500;
Tosohaas), in combination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas).
Elution took place at 30 C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate
at 0.8 mL/min. The eluate was monitored using a refractive
index (RI) detector (Shodex RI-71). Calibration was
performed using pullulans (Polymer Labs).
