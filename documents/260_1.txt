High-performance anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a Thermo Separation Products system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-20 column (3 mm ID \'b7 150 mm) in combination with a Dionex CarboPac PA guard column (3 mm \'b7 25 mm) and PAD-detection (Dionex) (Lee, 1996). Enzymatic released arabinose from WAX was analysed by using HPAEC performing an isocratic elution (0.5 mL/min) during 20 min with a solution of 18 mM NaOH. To analyse cellobiose (enzymatic released from BC) a gradient of 0\'96550 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH during 25 min was applied. Each elution was followed by a washing and equilibration step.
