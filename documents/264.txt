HPSEC (high-performance size-exclusion chromatography) was performed on a ThermoFinnigan (USA) HPLC, with three TSK gel columns (7.8 mm ID \'a330 cm per column) in series (G4000PWX , G3000PWXL, G2500PWXL; Tosohaas, Japan), in combination with a PWXL-guard column (Tosohaas, Japan). Elution was at 30 \'b0C using 0.2 mol/ L sodium nitrate at a Xow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The elution was monitored using a Shodex SE-61 refractive index detector. Calibration was performed using pullulans (Polymer Laboratories, UK). The data were processed using ChromQuest (ThermoFinnigan, USA).
