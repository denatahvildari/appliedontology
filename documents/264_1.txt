HPAEC (high-performance anion-exchange chromatography) was performed on a Dionex (USA) HPLC system. The system was equipped with a quaternary gradient pump, an autosampler completed with a helium degassing unit and an EC detector in the PAD mode. A CarboPac PA1 column (2\'a3250 mm) (Dionex, USA) with a CarboPac PA1 guard column (2\'a350 mm) (Dionex, USA) was operated at a Xow rate of 0.3 mL/min at 20 \'b0C. The gradient was obtained by mixing solutions of 0.1 mol/L NaOH and 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. After 15 min equilibration with 0.1 mol/L NaOH, 20L of the sample was injected and a linear gradient to 0.50 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH within 30 min was followed by a linear gradient in 5 min to 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. The data were processed using Chromeleon (Dionex, USA) software.
