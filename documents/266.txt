Anion-exchange chromatography was performed using a SpectraSystem HPLC (Thermo Separation Products, USA), equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2 mm ID \'b7 250 mm; Dionex, USA) in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column (2 mm ID \'b7 25 mm) and a ED40 PAD-detector (Dionex, USA). A flow rate of 0.2 mL/min was used with the following gradient of NaOAc buffer (pH 5.0) in water: 0\'968 min, 10 mM; 8\'9612 min, 175 mM; 12\'96108 min 175\'96860 mM. Each elution was preceded by a 15 min 10 mM NaOAc equilibration step and the run was completed with an 8 min 1 M NaOAc washing step. Oligomer detection was possible after post-column addition of NaOH (1 M; 0.2 mL/min). The eluate of the anion-exchange chromatography was desalted online by two desalting units, connected in-line after the PAD-detector.
