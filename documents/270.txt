Protein samples (100 l L) were applied onto a Superose 610/300 column (GE Healthcare). The column was equili-brated and eluted with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer,pH 7.6, with or without the addition of 0.1 M NaCl, at aflow rate of 0.5 mL/min using an  Akta Purifier system oper-ated at room temperature. The eluate was monitored at280 nm.
