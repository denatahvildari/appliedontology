Aqueous and saponified samples were analyzed by reversed-phase chromatography using a 150 mm \'d7 4.6 mm i.d. XTerra MS C18 3.5 \'b5m column in combination with a 20 mm \'d7 3.9 mm i.d. XTerra MS C18 3.5 \'b5m guard column (Waters, Milford, MA) using the procedure described previously (7). Aqueous 5-CQA and CA solutions were used as reference for the 5-CQA and unbound CA contents, respectively. Saponified CA solutions were used as reference for the total CA contents. Experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The average coefficient of variation was 1%.
