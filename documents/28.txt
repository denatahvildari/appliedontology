HPSEC analysis was conducted on three TSKgel columns (7.8 mm internal diameter\'ac30 cm\}column) in series (G4000 PWXL, G3000 PWXL, G2500 PWXL; Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany) in combination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas). Elution was performed at 30 \'b0C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.8 ml\}min. The effluent was monitored using a refractive index detector. Calibration was performed using dextrans, pectins and oligoGalpA.
