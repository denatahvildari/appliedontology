Size-exclusion FPLC was performed using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare, UK) pre-equilibrated with 1% (w/v) SDS in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). Three replicates of aliquots (0.1 ml) of SDS-soluble protein from flour and from PBs were loaded on the column without prior sonication and fractionated using a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Eluate fractions of 0.5 ml were collected for SDS-PAGE analysis. The elution pattern was monitored at 280 nm.
