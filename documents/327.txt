Fractionation by DP was performed on an Inertsil PREP-SIL 30 mm ID \'d7 250 mm column with a 10 \uc0\u956 m particle size (GL sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan). A Waters system equipped with a 2767 sample manager, a 2525 binary gradient module, a 2996 photodiode array detector (PDA) and an UV fraction manager was used. The binary mobile phase consisted of (A) hexane and (B) acetone. The elution was as follows: 0\'9630 min, 40\'9660% B; 30\'9650 min, isocratic at 60% B; 50\'9670 min, 60\'9675% B, followed by a washing step at 98% B for 3 min, and reconditioning of the column. The flow rate was 27.22 mL/min and PDA spectra from 210\'96300 nm were recorded. In a run, 10 mL (70 mg/mL in acetone/hexane/ethanol (7:3:2)) peanut skin extract or the tannase-treated grape seed extract was applied.
