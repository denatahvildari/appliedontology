Protein solutions (1 mg/ml) were dialyzed against the elution buffer (35 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6 containing 100 mM potassium chloride, I is 0.2 M) and applied to a Superdex 200 column (3.2 mM \'d7 300 mm) running on a SMART microLC system (Pharmacia) at 50 \uc0\u956 l/min. The eluent was monitored at 280 nm. The column was calibrated using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (242 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa) and serum albumin (67 kDa).
