products were purified by HPLC (UltiMate 300; Dionex, CA, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101; Showa Denko, Kanagawa, Japan) and a TSKgel Amide-80 column (4.6 \'d7 250 mm; Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) under a constant flow (1.0 mL\'b7min\uc0\u8722 1) of the mobile phase (acetonitrile/water 75 : 25, v/v) at 65 \'b0C. The purity of products in collected fractions was confirmed by TLC (TLC silica gel 60 F254; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), developed by acetonitrile/water (75 : 25, v/v) and sprayed with \u945 -naphthol/sulfuric acid (\u945 -naphthol/sulfuric acid/methanol, 0.03 : 15 : 85, w/v/v) followed by tarring at 120 \'b0C.
