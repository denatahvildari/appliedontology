The chromatographic separations were performed at room temperature. The exclusion limits for the columns were 20,000 and 1300 kg mol\uc0\u8722 1, respectively. Buffer containing 15 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl and 6 M urea at pH 7.0 (filtered and degassed) was used as eluent with a flow rate of 0.4 ml min\u8722 1. Sample injection volume was always 100 \u956 l. The SEC profiles of the eluting polymerized \u946 -caseins were determined with a UV/Vis detector linked on-line to the SEC system and operating at 280 nm.
