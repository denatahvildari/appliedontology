The molecular weight distribution of large oligosaccharide and polysaccharide fractions was investigated by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) using a Spectra System HPLC (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with a refractive index detector Shodex RI72 (Showa Denko K.K.). Twenty microliter sample solutions (5 mg/mL) were injected automatically, using a Thermo AS3000 autosampler. Separation was performed on three TosoH Biosep-TSK-Gel G columns in series (4000PWXL-415 3000PWXL-2500PWXL, each 300   7.5 mm; TosoH, Japan) in combination with a PWXL guard column (40   6 mm; TosoH). For elution, 0.2 M NaNO3 was used at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min at 30  C. The system was calibrated with pullulan standards (Sigma Chemical Co.; mass range from 180 Da to 790 kDa).
