BP-neutral was remethoxylated (RME) and b-eliminationwas carried out a second time as described above, followedby desalting/separation on three Superdex 30 columns(1.6 mm660 cm, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) con-nected in series eluted with 1.2 mL/min MilliQ watercoupled to a Shimadzu RID10A refractive index detectorand a SuperFrac (GE Healthcare) fraction collector. Twofractions were collected, one of high molecular weight (BP-neutral-A) and one of lower molecular weight (BP-neutral-B).
