All enzymes were subjected to Anion Exchange Chromatography (AEC) on a Source 15Q column (50/6; GE Healthcare, self-packed) and eluted at 20 ml/min. The samples were dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) overnight at 4 \'b0C and 15 ml sample was loaded onto the column at 5 ml/min. All enzymes were eluted using a sodium chloride (NaCl) gradient in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) comprising five segments: 0 mM NaCl for 4 column volumes (CV), a gradient of 0\'96500 mM NaCl over 20 CV, 500 mM NaCl for 4 CV, 1 M NaCl for 5 CV and 0 mM NaCl for 5 CV (equilibration). Abn2 and Abn4 were eluted with 40\'9665 mM NaCl and 43\'96129 mM NaCl, respectively. Abn1 did not bind to the column. However, a large amount of protein was bound during AEC and the unbound Abn1 was significantly purified. Fractions of 20 ml were collected for all samples.
