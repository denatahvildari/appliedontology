the molecular size distribution of samples was determined by using High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC). For this analysis, a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex Corporation, CA, USA) was used. This system was equipped with three TosoHaas TSKgel SuperAW columns in series (4000\'963000\'962500, 150 mm \'d7 6 mm) preceded by a SuperAW-L guard column (TosoH, Japan). After injection of 20 \uc0\u956 l of a 2 mg/ml sample solution in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0), elution was performed with 0.2 M NaNO3 at 40 \'b0C, using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A Shodex RI-101 RI detector (Showa Denko K.K., Japan) was used. A calibration curve was made by means of a series of pullulans with known molecular weights. Data were processed using Chromeleon software (Dionex Corporation).
