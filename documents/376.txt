To determine the degree of polymerization (DP) of the oligosaccharides present in the filtrate, it was analyzed by high-performance size exclusion chromatograp (HPSEC). A Dionex Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a set of four TSK-Gel super AW columns (Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) in series, guard column (6 mm i.d.  40 mm) and separation columns 4000, 3000, and 2500 (6 mm i.d.  150 mm), was used. Elution was performed with filtered aqueous 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 40  C at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and followed by refractive index detection (Shodex RI, Showa Denko K.K., Kawasaki, Japan).
