An HPAEC system (ICS-3000, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column and a CarboPac PA-1 guard column (2 mm ID \'d7 250 mm and 2 mm ID \'d7 25 mm; Dionex Corporation). A flow of 0.3 mL/min was used and the temperature was kept at 20 \'b0C. AOS (injection volume 10 \uc0\u956 L; 10\'96100 \u956 g/mL) were separated using a gradient with 0.1 M NaOH (solution A) and 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH (solution B): 0\'9636 min from 0% B to 42% B, 36\'9642 min at 100% B, and 42\'9657 min at 0% B.6.
