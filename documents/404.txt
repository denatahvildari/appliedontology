The oligosaccharide molar mass distribution of RH-XOS was determined by HPSEC using an Agilent instrument fitted with a refractive index detector using two TSKGel columns (7.8 mm i.d.  30 cm per column) in series (G2500PWXL, G3000PWXL; Tosoh Bioscience) in combination with a PWX-guard column. Elution took place at 30  C with 0.05 M KNO3 containing 83 mg sodium azide/L at 0.6 mL/min. Dextrans (1000-80,000 Da) from Fluka, malto-OS (DP 2 to DP 7) from Supelco and XOS (DP 2 to DP 6 from Megazymes) were used as calibration standards.
