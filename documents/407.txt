Samples were analyzed on an Akta purifier (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). A Superdex 75 column with a bed volume of 23.5 mL was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Next, 50 \uc0\u956 L of sample was injected onto the column. Detection took place at 214 nm. The column was calibrated using the proteins BSA, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease, with a mass of 67000, 42750, 20200, and 15700 Da, respectively.The amount of native-like \uc0\u946 -lactoglobulin was determined by the peak area at the time interval of 11 13 min. The peak area of the nativelike fraction \uc0\u946 -lactoglobulin divided by the peak area of unheated \uc0\u946 -lactoglobulin was defined as Ct/C0. These values were used to calculate the reaction order of denaturation/aggregation using eq 3.
