These compounds were quantified in the pretreated Liquids using a Shimadzu (\'92s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) HPLC system with column oven CTO-10A-vp and Autoinjector SIL-10AD-vp equipped with a guard column (Bio-Rad H cartridge) and an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 \'d7 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Elution took place at 80 \'b0C with 5 mM H2SO4 at 0.6 mL min\uc0\u8722 1. The eluate was monitored using a Refractive Index detector RID-10A (Shimadzu, \'92s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands).
