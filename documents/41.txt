High-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) was performed on a Dionex system with pulsed amperometric detection. The Carbopac PA1 column was eluted with 0.5 M NaOH, 1 M sodium acetate and water at 1 ml/min as follows: initial conditions, 20/30/50; 30 min, 20/60/20; 30\'9634 min, 20/60/20; 35 min, 20/30/50. Monomer, dimer and trimer of GalA (Sigma Aldrich) and oligomers of dp 4\'9610, purified from autohydrolysis of polygalacturonic acid (Bonnin et al., 2002a), were used as standards.
