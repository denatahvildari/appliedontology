Samples (100 \uc0\u956 L) were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) Ultimate 3000 UPLC-system equipped with a Shodex RI-101 (Kawasaki, Japan) refractive index (RI) detector and an Animex HPX 87H column (300 mm \'d7 7.8 mm) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) plus pre-column (Voragen, Schols, & Pilnik, 1986). Elution was performed by using 5 mM H2SO4 as eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min\u8722 1 at 40 \'b0C.
