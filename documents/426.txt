Cross-linked protein samples (20 \uc0\u956 L, 5 mg/mL) in 0.1 M ammonium acetate at pH 6.8 were applied to a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column connected to an :: Akta Purifier system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at room temperature. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 0.1 M ammonium acetate at pH 6.8 at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Calibration of the column was performed with a low-molecular-mass SEC calibration kit (GE Healthcare). The kit contained blue dextran (2000 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa).
