Analysis of higher alcohols and other volatile substances was performed using gas chromatography (GC). A Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a split-splitless injector and a FID detector was used in all measurements. The injection temperature was 200 \'b0C and helium served as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 ml min\uc0\u8722 1. Chromatographic separation was accomplished with a column Zebron ZB-WAX (30 m \'d7 0.25 mm \'d7 0.25 \u956 m, 100% polyethylene glycol, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The temperature program used was: initial temperature of 40 \'b0C for 5 min, rising to 100 \'b0C at a rate of 4 \'b0C min\u8722 1, and a 2 min hold. The detection temperature was set at 250 \'b0C.
