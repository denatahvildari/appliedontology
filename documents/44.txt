To fractionate the AcXOS-mixture (163 mg in 2 mL) a Pharmacia system equipped with a BioGel P-2 column (900\'d726 mm; 200\'96400 mesh, Bio-Rad Laboratories) thermostated at 60 \'b0C was used. Elution was performed at 0.5 mL/min with water (60 \'b0C) and fractions were collected every 2 mL. The eluent was detected by a Shodex RI-72 detector. Four of these size-exclusion runs were performed to obtain sufficient material of pool X4Ac.
