The molar mass distribution of XOS present in the refined product was determined by HPSEC performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, USA) using three TosoH Bioscience TSK-gel columns in series (4000, 3000, 2500 SuperAW, 6.0 mm ID \'d7 15.0 cm L; TosoH, Japan) preceded by a TSK SuperAW-L guard column (4.6 mm ID \'d7 3.5 cm L; TosoH, Japan). The sample (50 \uc0\u956 l, concentration 5 mg/ml) was injected and eluted at 40 \'b0C using 0.5 ml/min 0.2 M NaNO3. Detection was performed using a Shodex RI101 Refractive Index detector (Showa Denko K.K., Japan). Calibration was done using a pullulan series.
