The digests were 100\'d7 diluted with Millipore water and analyzed by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) using an ICS3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2 mm ID \'d7 250 mm; Dionex) in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column (2 mm ID \'d7 25 mm) and a ISC3000 ED PAD-detector (Dionex). A flowrate of 0.3 mL/min was used with the following gradient of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 1 M sodium acetate (NaOAc) in 0.1 M NaOH: 0\'9645 min, 0\'96500 mM NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH; 45\'9648 min washing step with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH; 48\'9660 min, equilibration with 0.1 M NaOH.
