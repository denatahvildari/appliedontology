The molecular weight distribution of the polysaccharides and the enzymatic digests were determined by HPSEC using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex), equipped with an RI72 refractive index detector (Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Twenty microliter sample solutions (1 mg/mL) were injected, and separation was performed on three Tosoh TSK gel superAW columns in series (AW4000- AW3000- AW2500, each 6 mm  150 mm; Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) in combination with a guard column (3.5 mm  46 mm; Tosoh). For elution, 0.2 M sodium nitrate was used at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 55  C. The system was calibrated with pullulan standards (Sigma Aldrich; mass range 180 Da to 790 kDa).
