FaeA1 was purified by size exclusion chromatography using an \'c4KTApurifier 10 analytical system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a Superdex\'99 75 analytical column (10/300 GL, 1 column volume (CV) = 23.56 ml; GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 20 \'b0C. The sample was manually injected via a 200 \uc0\u956 l sample loop and eluted with 50 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Fractions of 200 \u956 l were collected in microtiter plates using an \'c4KTA Frac-950 fraction collector (GE Healthcare).
