The samples were diluted with water (1:1 (v/v)) before analysis. The diluted samples (20 \uc0\u956 l) were injected into an Ultimate 3000 (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system coupled to a Shodex RI-101 refractive index detector (Showa Denko KK, Kawasaki, Japan), equipped with an Aminex HPX-87 H column (300 \'d7 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad, Richmond, VA, USA) and a guard column. The eluent was 5 mM H2SO4, eluted at 40 \'b0C with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min.
