A GC-8000top gas chromatograph (CE Instru-ments, Milan, Italy) was equipped with a CP-SIL 5 CB low bleed column (30 m \'d7 0.25 mm,film thickness: 1.0 mm, Chrompack, Mid-delburg, The Netherlands) and a flame ion-ization detector (FID). The oven tempera-ture was initially 40 \'b0C for 2 min, thenincreasing by 25 \'b0C/min to 250 \'b0C and was kept at 250 \'b0C for 10 min. Inlet and detectortemperatures were 250 and 270 \'b0C, respec-tively. Gas flow rates were as follows: hydro-gen, 35 mL/min; air 350 mL/min, make-upnitrogen, 30 mL/min.
