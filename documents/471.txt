to determine the molecular weight distribution of polysaccharides and large oligosaccharides, high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was performed on an Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with three TSKgel SuperAW columns (6.0 mm ID \'d7 15 cm per column; 4 \uc0\u956 m) in series (SuperAW4000, SuperAW3000, SuperAW2500; Tosohaas Bioscience, Stuttgart, Germany), in combination with a guard column (Tosohaas Bioscience). Elution took place at 55 \'b0C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.6 mL/min. The eluate was monitored with a Shodex RI-101 (Kawasaki, Japan) refractive index (RI) detector. The system was calibrated with a pullulan series (Sigma\'96Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
