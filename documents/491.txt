For the determination of the proportion of intact protein in the hydrolysates, size exclusion chromatography was performed with the same system using a Shodex protein KW-802.5 column (Showa Denko K. K., Kanagawa, Japan). The eluent was 6 M urea in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The flow rate was 600 \uc0\u956 L\'b7min\u8722 1. The samples were first diluted to 0.5% (w/v) by addition of a solution containing 6 M urea, 100 mM DTT in 50 mM Tris, HCl, pH 8 and left for incubation for 2 h at room temperature. ACN and TFA were added to the samples to reach final concentrations of 30% (w/v) ACN and 0.1% (w/v) TFA; the final concentration of the samples was 0.1% (w/v). After centrifugation (10 min, 19000g, 20 \'b0C), samples (20 \uc0\u956 L) were injected onto the column. Detection was performed at 220 and 280 nm.
