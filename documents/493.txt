Monosaccharide analysis was performed using a Dionex ICS 3000 High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) system (Sunnyvale, CA, USA), with pulsed amperometric detection. Samples were diluted 500 \'d7 with water before analysis and 20 \uc0\u956 L was injected into the system. Separation was achieved using a CarboPac PA-1 column (2 \'d7 250 mm) preceded by a CarboPac PA-1 guard column (2 \'d7 250 mm). The monomers in the samples were eluted with a gradient of 0.02\'960.05 M NaOH for 3 min and 0.05\'960.075 M NaOH for 10 min, followed by isocratic elution of 0.1 M NaOH for 2 min. Subsequently, the column was washed with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH for 7 min. Equilibration of the column was achieved in 0.1 M NaOH for 3 min followed by 0.02 M NaOH for 20 min.
