HPLC analyses of phenolic compounds were performed by using a Shimadzu HPLC system, equipped with two SCL-10-AVP pumps, an SLC-10-AVP controller, and an SPD-20A UV/Vis detector. Analyses were performed with a C18 RP-column (150 mm \'d7 4.6 mm id, 5 \uc0\u956 m particle size) (Supelco). The solvent system used was a gradient of solvent A (water with 0.1% H3PO4) and solvent B (acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Gradient elution was performed as follows: 0\'9625 min, linear gradient from 15% to 40% solvent B; 25\'9635 min, linear gradient from 40% to 60% solvent B; 35\'9640 min, linear gradient from 60% to 70% solvent B; in additional 5 min the column was then reconditioned with the initial eluent. The detector was set at 284 nm to detect hydroxybenzoic acids and flavanones at 325 nm to detect hydroxycinammic acids.
