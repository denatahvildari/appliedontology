Preparative size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a column (75 \'a3 2.6 cm) of Sephacryl S 500 (Pharmacia) using a Hiload system (Pharmacia). The sample (0.5 g) was eluted with 0.05 M NaOAc pH 5.0 at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Fractions obtained by preparative size-exclusion chromatography were assayed for total neutral sugar (Tollier & Robin, 1979) and uronic acid (Thibault, 1979) content, using arabinose and galacturonic acid as standards. A correction was made for the response of uronic acids in the neutral sugar test. Pooled fractions were dialyzed and freeze-dried.
