High-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) was performed on an Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2 mm x 250 mm ID) in combination with a CarboPac guard column (2 mm x 50 mm ID) and PAD detection. System was controlled by the Chromelion software (Dionex). Separation and quantification of monosaccharides was done at a flow rate 0.4 ml/min, and the mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1 M NaOH, (B) 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH and (C) H2O. The elution profile was as follows: 0\'9640 min 100% C; 40.1-45.1 min from 100% A to 100% B, 45.1-50 min 100% B, 50.1-58 min 100% A, 58.1-73 min 100% C. From 0 to 40 min and from 58 to 73 min post column addition of 0.5 M NaOH at 0.1 ml/min was performed to detect and quantify the eluted saccharides.
