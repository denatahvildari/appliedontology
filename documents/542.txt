HPAEC was performed on an ICS5000 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2 mm ID \'d7 250 mm; Dionex) in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column (2 mm ID \'d7 25 mm) and an ISC5000 ED PAD-detector (Dionex). The digests were centrifuged (10,000 \'d7 g; 10 min; 25 \'b0C) and 2\'d7 diluted before injection onto the column (10 \uc0\u956 l). Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min\u8722 1 with the following elution profile of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 1 M sodium acetate (NaOAc) in 0.1 M NaOH: 0\'9610 min, 0\'9650 mM NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH; 10\'9635 min, 50\'96400 mM NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH; 35\'9640 min, 400\'961000 mM NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH; 40\'9645 min washing step with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH; 45\'9660 min, equilibration with 0.1 M NaOH.
