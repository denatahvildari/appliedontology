HPLC was performed with a Waters M600 liquid chromatography system. Analytical separations were achieved using an Alltima C18 5U column (4.6 mm \'d7 150 mm) (Alltech, Breda, The Netherlands). The column was eluted with water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, in a linear gradient with 0-30% acetonitrile, in 18 min, followed by 2 min isocratic elution with 30% acetonitrile, followed by 30-40% acetonitrile from 20 to 25 min, 40-60% acetonitrile from 25 to 28 min, 60-100% acetonitrile from 28 to 30 min, and 100% acetonitrile from 30 to 35 min. A flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and an injection loop of 10 \'b5L were used. Detection was carried out with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector and performed between 200 and 450 nm. Chromatograms presented are based on detection at 290 nm.
