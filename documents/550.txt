 High-performance size
exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was performed on an Ultimate
3000 HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using three TSK-Gel
columns connected in series (4000\uc0\u8722 3000\u8722 2500 SuperAW; 150 \'d7 6
mm). The columns were preceded by a TSK Super AW-L guard
column (35 \'d7 4.6 mm). All columns were from Tosoh Bioscience
(Tokyo, Japan). Sodium nitrate (0.2 M) was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. A volume of 20 \uc0\u956 L of the sample (2.5 mg/
mL in 0.01 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) was injected and eluted
at 55 \'b0C. Solubles were detected using a refractive index detector,
Shodex type RI 101 (Showa Denko, Japan). The software used for
acquiring the data was Chromeleon version 7. The molecular mass
distribution of polysaccharides was determined using pullulan
standards (Polymer Laboratories, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA)
in the molecular mass range 0.18\uc0\u8722 790 kDa.
