The amount of butyl butyrate formed was determined using gas chromatography (Focus GC with AS3000 autosampler, Interscience, Breda, Netherlands). The system was calibrated using butyl butyrate. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a Flame ionisation Detector and a Restek Rxi-5 ms column with dimensions of 30 m * 0.25 mm * 0.25 \uc0\u956 m. The carrier gas was helium and the make-up gas was nitrogen. Conditions: injection volume was 1 \u956 L; oven temperature was 50 \'b0C for 2 min and was then raised to 300 \'b0C at a rate of 20 \'b0C minute and stayed at 300 \'b0C for 2 min; software was Chrom-Card v2.4.1.
