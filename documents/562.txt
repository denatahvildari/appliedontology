Mate extract was fractionated using a 12 g Reveleris C18 column on a Reveleris flash chromatography system (Grace, Deerfield, IL, USA) operated at 30 mL/min. Twenty milliliters of a 30 g/L solution of mate extract in MQ was applied onto the column. Water acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, eluent A, and ACN acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, eluent B, were used as eluents. The following elution profile was used: 0\uc0\u8722 2 min, isocratic on 0% (v/v) B; 2\u8722 3 min, linear gradient from 0 to 30% (v/v) B; 3\u8722 8 min, isocratic at 30% (v/v) B; 8\u8722 13 min, linear gradient from 30 to 100% (v/v) B; 13\u8722 15 min, isocratic at 100% (v/v) B. Fractions of 10 mL were collected and pooled on the basis of RP-UHPLC-MS analysis.
