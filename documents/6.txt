 High performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) was performed using a SpectraSystem P4000 (Thermo Separation Products) equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 \'d7 250 mm) column and a Dionex ED40 Electrochemical Detector in de Pulsed Amperometric Detection mode. The samples were analyzed using a linear gradient of 0\'96400 mm sodium acetate in 100 mm sodium hydroxide for 40 min d-galactose, d-galactobiose and d-galactotetraose were used as standards to identify the d-galactose and d-galacto-oligosaccharides. The calculated areas for d-galactose and d-galacto-oligosaccharides were expressed as percentages of the area of 1 mm d-galactose.}
