 HPLC analysis was performed by injecting 50 \'b5l of the extracted material of B. subtilis on a Spherisorp ODS-2 column, 4\'b76 mm \'d7\uc0\u8202 250 mm (Chrompack, Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands) and monitoring at 214 and 280 nm. Elution (0\'b79 ml min\u8722 1) was performed in a linear gradient in methanol:water (50:50 v/v) during 0\'9620 min, methanol:water (80:20 v/v) during 20\'9660 min, 100% methanol during 60\'9665 min and methanol:water (50:50 v/v) during 65\'9675 min.
