 After thawing, the 14000-rpm supernatant was
analyzed with HPLC, performed with a Waters M600
liquid chromatography system (Millipore Corporation,
Bedford MA). Quercetin was quantified using
an Alltima C18 5U column (4.6 \'a3 150 mm; Alltech,
Breda, The Netherlands), eluting at a flow of
1 ml/min. The injection volume was 10 ml. The
gradient used for analysis of quercetin in the 0.1 M
potassium phosphate pH 7.4 series was described
previously [11]. The McCoy\'92s medium series were
analyzed with a gradient starting at 0% acetonitril in
nanopure water containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid for
2 min, going from 0 to 70% acetonitril in 22 min,
keeping this percentage for 2 min and returning to 0%
acetonitril in 1 min. Detection was performed
between 230 and 420 nm using a Waters 996
photodiode array detector. Quercetin peak areas at
370 nm were used to quantify the amount of
quercetin; amounts are expressed as percentage of
the peak area at t \'bc 0 min.
