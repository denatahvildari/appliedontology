Betaine, carnitine and choline were measured by refractive index after HPLC using a LiChrosphere 100-NH2, 5 \'b5m column (Merck, darmstadt, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 ml min\uc0\u8722 1 at 45\'b0C with a mobile phase of 80:20 (v/v) acetonitril\u8722 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Osmolyte concentrations were calculated from the area under the respective peaks using calibration curves.
