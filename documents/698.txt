Gel permeation chromatography was performed on a LC-10Ai HPLC (Shimadzu Benelux's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) equipped with a Superdex Peptide column (17-5003-01; Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and elution at 30C with 0\'b71 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile at 75 ml/min. The eluate was monitored using a UV detector at 200 nm. Calibration was performed using proteins and peptides ranging from 200 to 7000 Da.
