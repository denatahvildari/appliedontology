High-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was performed on three Bio-Gel TSK columns in series (60XL\'9640XL\'9630XL) as described (Oosterveld, Beldman, Schols, & Voragen, 2000) using 0.2 M NaNO3 as eluens. The effluent was partitioned in fractions of 0.24 ml using a Gilson FC-203B fraction collector. The fractions obtained by HPSEC were pooled as indicated in the corresponding figures and the sugar compositions were determined by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) after hydrolysis with 2 M TFA as described by Ruiter, Schols, Voragen, & Rombouts (1992).
