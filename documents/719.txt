Phytic acid was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Bentsink, Yuan, Koornneef, & Vreugdenhil, 2003) using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) DX300, ICS2500 system with a suppressed conductivity detector range of 10 \uc0\u956 S. An AS11 chromatographic column (Dionex) with a guard column was used. All analyses (20 \u956 l injection volume) were carried out at room temperature. The eluents (flow rate 1 ml min\u8722 1) used were as follows: 0\'965min, 0.2 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH; 5\'9615 min, linear gradient of 0.2\'964 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH; 15\'9620 min, 20 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH; finally 20\'9635 min, 0.2 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH.
