High performance liquid chromatography was performed with a Shimadzu Class 10A equipped with a diode array detector (Shimadzu SPD-M10A) and a 100 ml loop. Injection volume was 50 ml. The column used was a Hypersil ODS5 with 125   4 mm inner diameter and 5 mm particle size. The column was thermostated at 40 C. Total flow was 1 ml/min. The eluents were water (A) and methanol (B). The gradient went from 30% to 90% solvent B in 8 minutes where it was held for 10 minutes. The concentration of methanol was reduced back to 30% in 0.1 minutes and held for 6.9 minutes to equilibrate. The retention times of the analytes were: laurolactam 9.4, dimer 10.8, trimer 12.2, and tetramer 12.9 minutes. The detection wavelength used was set at 207 nm.
