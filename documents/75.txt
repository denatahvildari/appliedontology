Gas chromatography was run on a HS-GC equipped with a flame ionisation detector and an automatic injection system. Column: DB-WAX 30 \'a3 0.53 \'a3 1.0. The following conditions were used: helium as carrier gas with a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Column temperature was set at 40 8C for 5 min and then programmed to 150 8C at a rate of 10 8C/min. The injector was set at 200 8C and the detector performed at 225 8C. The integration was achieved using ChromCard software. Samples were heated at 50 8C for10 min in the head-space sampler. Two ml of the head-spacvolatiles was automatically injected in 10 s on the column.
