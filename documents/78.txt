The native molecular mass was determined by gel exclusion chromatography, using the \'c4kta Purifier equipped with a Superdex 200 HR column (Amersham). The column was calibrated with high- and low-molecular-mass standards for gel permeation (Amersham). Elution was performed with 20 mM piperazine buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.15 M NaCl at a flow rate of 38 cm h\uc0\u8722 1.
