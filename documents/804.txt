The profile of anthocyanidins and corresponding glycosides and phenolic compounds was determined using a HPLC system (Shimadzu, Korneuburg, Austria) consisting of a SPD-M10AVP photodiode array detector, a chromatogram integrator, a LC-10ADVP pump, and an online degasser. Data signals were processed on a personal computer (PC) running the LC solution Multi software (Shimadzu, Korneuburg, Austria). Analytical separation of anthocyanidins and phenolic acids was carried out using a Phenomenex Luna 250  4.6 mm, 5 \uc0\u956 m (HPLC Services, Breitenfurt, Austria) column.
