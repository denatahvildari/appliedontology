Concentrations of residual glucose and organic acids in the culture supernatant were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To this end, cells were removed from 2\uc0\u8201 ml of culture samples by centrifugation (20\u8201 000\u8201 g for 2\u8201 min at 4\'b0C), the obtained supernatant was filter sterilized and stored at \u8722 20\'b0C until HPLC analysis. After the supernatants had been separated by HPLC using a Rezex ROA-organic acid column (300\u8201 \'d7\u8201 7.8\u8201 mm) (Phenomenex, CA, USA), with sulphuric acid (5\u8201 mM; 0.6\u8201 ml\u8201 min\u8722 1) as mobile phase at 60\'b0C, lactate, acetate, formate and ethanol were detected by refractive index detector (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, MD, USA).
