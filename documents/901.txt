Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (Waters, Milford, MA) on a chromatograph equipped with Galaxie software (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). An Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was eluted with sulfuric acid (5 mM, 0.6 ml/min) at 59\'b0C. Detection was by means of a dual-wavelength absorbance detector (Waters 2487) and a refractive index detector (Waters 2410).
