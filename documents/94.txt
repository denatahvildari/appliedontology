Aliquots (10 \'b5L) of each sample were analyzed using HPLC [Waters M600 liquid chromatography system, equipped with an Alltima C18 column, 150 \'d7 4.6 mm (Alltech, Breda, The Netherlands)]. The gradient was made with ultrapure water containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. The flow rate used was 0.7 mL/min. A linear gradient from 10 to 30% (v/v) acetonitrile in water was applied during 12 min. The percentage of acetonitrile was kept at 30% (v/v) for 2 min, increased to 100% in 3 min, was kept at 100% for 2 min, lowered to 10% (v/v), and calibrated at these initial conditions for 10 min. The retention time of 1\uc0\u8242 -hydroxysafrole under these conditions was 22.5 min. Detection was carried out by a Waters 996 photodiode array detector at 280 nm.
