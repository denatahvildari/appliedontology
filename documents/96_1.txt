Anion exchange chromatography was performed on a FPLC system AKTA explorer equipped with a UV-900 monitor and Frac-900 fraction collector (AmershamBiosciences, United Kingdom), using Q-Sepharose columns (0.7 cm \'d7 2.5 cm for analytical runs and 2.6 cm \'d7 40 cm for preparative runs, respectively). Samples were eluted with a buffer system consisting of 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 M NaCl, with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 100%, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The fractions collected were dialyzed (cutoff membrane, 15 kDa) and lyophilized prior to further characterization.
