The amount of hexanal formed in the course of oil oxidation was
measured using a Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy) GC 8000 TOP gas
chromatograph equipped with a COMBI-PAL (CTC Analytics,
Zwingen, Switzerland) headspace sampler and a wide-bore thickfilm
capillary DB-WAX column (30 m; 0.54 mm i.d.; 1 mm
thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, USA). The temperature
program was as follows: 0 to 5 min at 50 C (isothermal),
increasing to 150 C at 10 C/min, then over 25 min gradually
decreasing to 50 C. The samples were incubated at 60 C for
10 min in a 2,000 rpm agitator operating with a 10 s run/10 s stop
cycle prior to injection. The volatiles were cold-trapped in MFA
815 cold trap (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) at 110 C and injected
ballistically into the column at 240 C; the headspace sample
volume was 2 ml. The helium pressure was 30 kPa; the injection
syringe temperature was 70 C; the injector temperature was
200 C; and the flame ionization detector temperature was 225 C.
GC data was processed with Chrom Card integration software
(Carlo Erba).
