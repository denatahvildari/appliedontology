Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (5) using
bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on the Pharmacia Phastsystem
according to the instructions of the supplier (Amersham). Coomassie brilliant
blue staining was used for the detection of proteins on PhastGel 10 to15%
gradient gels (Amersham). The native molecular mass was estimated by size
exclusion chromatography using the Akta Purifier equipped with a Superdex 200
PG column (Amersham), as described above. The column was calibrated with
thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158
kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen
A (25 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa).
