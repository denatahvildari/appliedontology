Degree of acetylation and methyl esterification
The degree of acetylation and methyl esterification of samples
were determined after saponification with 0.4 M sodium hydroxide
in isopropanol/water (50/50 v/v) by using Thermo Finnigan
(USA) high performance liquid chromatography equipped with
Aminex HPX 87H column (Bio-Rad, USA).55 The elution took place
at 40 C with 0.01 N H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The degree
of acetylation and methyl esterification were calculated as moles of
acetic acids and methanol per 100 moles of galacturonic acid,
respectively.
