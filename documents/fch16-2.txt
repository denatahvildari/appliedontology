High performance size exclusion chromatography
(HPSEC) High performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was
performed on a Thermo Separation Products (USA) HPLC, equipped
with three TosoH Biosep-TSK-Gel G columns (Methyacrylate resin)
in series (7.8 mm  30 cm, 4000PWXL???3000PWXL???2500PWXL) in
combination with a PWXL-guard column (TosoH, Japan). Samples
(5 mg/mL; except for HBSS: 1 mg/mL) were eluted at 30 C with
0.2 M sodium nitrate at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.57 The column
effluent was monitored using a reflective index detector (Shodex
SE-61, Showa Denko K.K., Japan). Calibration was done using pectins
having known molecular weight.20
