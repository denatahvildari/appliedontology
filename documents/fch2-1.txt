Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography(HILIC)-MSnSBP digests, diluted to 1 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile,were analysed using an Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific,Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an evaporative light scatteringdetector (Agilent 1200 series, Gen Tech Scientific, NY, USA) and anESI-IT-MSn-detector (LTQ Velos Pro, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA,USA). Chromatographic separation was performed on an AcquityUPLC BEH Amide column as described previously (Remoroza et al.,2014). Various pectin samples within the SBP series were modi-fied by BliPAE and analyzed by HILIC-MSnbut only one sample waschosen as the representative of SBPs in Table 1.2.4.3. NMR spectroscopyLiquid state1H NMR spectroscopy was conducted at14.095 Tesla (600 MHz1H frequency) with a 5 mm smart probe anda Bruker Advance III spectrometer. The samples (B5519, B1713)before and after BliPAE treatment were dissolved (5 mg/ml) in D2O(99.9 atom% D, Sigma???Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). NMR spectrawere recorded at a probe temperature of 353 K collecting 64scans. The spectra were acquired using standard pulse sequencesdelivered by Bruker. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts permillion (ppm) relative to internal trimethylsilyl propanoic acid(TMSP).3. Results and discussion
