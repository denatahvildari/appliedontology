High-performance anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a Thermo-Quest HPLC system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm ID 7 250 mm) column in combination with a Dionex CarboPac PA guard column (3 mm ID 7 25 mm) and a Dionex ED40 PAD-detector (Dionex Co., Sunnyvale, USA). A flow rate of 1 mL/min was used. Arabinogalacto-oligosaccharides were determined using a gradient of sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH: 9640 min,96400 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 40 41 min,  mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 41\'9646 min, 1000 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 46\'96 60 min, 100 mM NaOH.  The determination of the sugar composition was performed using the same HPAEC system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA20 (3 mm ID 7  150 mm) in combination with CarboPac PA20 guard column (3 mm ID 'b7  30 mm) and Borate trap (4 mm ID 7  50 mm) and separated at 0.5 mL/min by isocratic elution with 3 mM NaOH for 20 min followed by applying a linear gradient from 0 to 700 mM NaOH in 20 min.
