Reversed-phase HPLC NMR was performed on a HPLC system (Bruker) equipped with a Thermohypersil Aquasil C18 column (4.6 mm ID??~150 mm; 3 m) in combination with a Thermohypersil (Keystone Scientific) Aquasil C18 guard column (4.6 mm ID ~10 mm; 3 m). Furthermore, the HPLC system was connected to a Bruker peak sampling unit (BPSU; Bruker) following UV detection (205 nm; Bruker). Elution (0.8 mL/min) was performed using a gradient of degassed (Membrane degasser; Bruker) methanol in D2O: 0 16 v/v% methanol in 0 40 min. Samples containing mainly X4Ac (10 mg/mL) or X3Ac (15 mg/mL),  obtained by size-exclusion chromatography, were applied to RP-HPLC  NMR (100  L/ run). Each elution was followed by a equilibration step (isocratic D2 O; 30 min). Samples were transported one by one from the BPSU to the NMR probe, using the same ratio of D2 O/ methanol as was necessary for the particular oligomers to elute from the RP-column. NMR spectra were recorded at a probe temperature of 25 C on a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer located at the Wageningen NMR Centre. Solvent signals were suppressed with double presaturation using Bruker LC  NMR software. 1 H chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to methanol (3.34). 1D 1 H NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz using up to 2000 scans of 32,768 data points and a sweep width of 8000 Hz. The 2D TOCSY spectrum was acquired using a standard Bruker pulse sequence. 496 experiments of 2048 data points were recorded using 240 scans per increment resulting in a measuring time of 66 h. The mixing time was 65 ms.
