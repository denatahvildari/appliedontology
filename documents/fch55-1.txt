The released sugars were analyzed using high
performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC)
with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) using a Dionex
system containing a ThermoQuest HPLC system and a
Dionex EDM Helium degas unit. After hydrolysis the
samples were injected on a Carbopac PA10 column
(4 250 mm) with a Carbopac PA10 guard column (4
50 mm) preceded with a borate trap (Dionex) and separated at
1 mL/min by isocratic elution with water for 40 min followed
by a linear gradient from 0 to 800 mM NaOH in 30 min.
Detection was performed after the post column addition
of 0.5mL/min of 1M NaOH using a Dionex ED 40 PAD
detector.
