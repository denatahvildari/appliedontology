Sugar phosphates in the NaOH hydrolysate of the WTA were
analyzed on an Accela UPLC system (Thermo Fischer Scientific)
coupled to a LTQ-XL Linear Iontrap Mass Spectrometer equipped
with an electrospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
as described by Leijdekkers et al.25 with minor modifications. Chromatographic
separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH
amide (Waters) column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with an oven
temperature of 35 C. Compounds were eluted using a gradient of
CH3CN in 10 mM ammonium formate???0.1% (v/v) formic acid buffer
(pH 3.0), with the following elution profile: 0???1 min, isocratic 80%
CH3CN (v/v); 1???31 min, 80???50%; 31???36 min, 50???20%. Ions were detected
