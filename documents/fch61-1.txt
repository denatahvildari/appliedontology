 The native molecular mass was estimated by size-exclusion chromatography using the Akta Purifier equipped with a Superdex 200 PG column (Amersham). The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Elution was performed with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl at a flow rate of 76 cm/h.
