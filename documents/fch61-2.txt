For kinetic experiments, -D-Galp-(1,4)-D-Galp [hereafter referred to as Gal concentration was varied in the range of 0.05???8.0 mg/ml and measured by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). The reactions were carried out in 2 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and 0.12 U/ml - galactosidase for 60 min at 37??C. The incubations were stopped by heating the incubation mixtures for 5 min at 100??C. After centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 g) the supernatant was analysed by HPAEC using a Dionex system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm ID ??~ 250 mm) column in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column (3 mm ID ??~25 mm) and a pulsed electrochemical detector in pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) mode (Dionex, Sunnyvale, Calif.). A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used with the following gradient of sodium acetate in 0.1 M NaOH: 0???15 min, 0???100 mM; 15???20 min, 100???200 mM; 20 21 min, . Each elution was followed by a washing step of 5 min in 1,000 mM sodium acetate and an equilibration step of 15 min 0.1 M NaOH. The hydrolytic activity of ??-Gal II towards different types of oligosaccharides was measured by HPAEC, using the same gradient as for the kinetic experiments. The incubations were performed with 1 mg/ml substrate under the conditions described above.
