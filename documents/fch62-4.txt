For purification of 100 mg or less lignan macromolecule constituents, the samples were separated on a semi-preparative X-Terra C18 MS column (Waters; 5 l m particle size, 29  150 mm, OBD) with an X-Terra C18 MS guard column (Waters; 5 l m particle size, 19 ??  10 mm) ran on a Waters preparative HPLC system as specified above. The gradient was similar to the gradient of analytical RPHPLC. The flow rate was 12 ml/min. Fractions were collected based on the response at 280 nm as described for preparative RP-HPLC. The purity of the fractions was determined using analytical RP-HPLC and the purified components were lyophilized after evaporation of ACN.
